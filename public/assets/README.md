# Portrait Image for Monochrome Pointillism

## Required: michelangelo.jpg

This directory should contain a high-contrast, public-domain portrait image named `michelangelo.jpg` (or any portrait you prefer).

### Recommendations:
- **High contrast**: The algorithm works best with strong light/dark areas
- **Square or portrait aspect ratio**: Works well with the pointillism algorithm
- **Public domain or licensed**: Ensure you have rights to use the image
- **Resolution**: 1000x1000px or higher works well

### Alternative Options:
1. **Replace the filename** in `index.html` line that references `assets/michelangelo.jpg`
2. **Use a remote URL** via `?img=https://example.com/portrait.jpg` (must allow CORS)
3. **Any portrait** - the algorithm works with any high-contrast face/portrait image

### Current Setup:
The pointillism canvas will display a placeholder/error message until you add a proper portrait image here.
