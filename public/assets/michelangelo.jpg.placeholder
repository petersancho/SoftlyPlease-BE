PLACEHOLDER: Replace this file with michelangelo.jpg

This is a placeholder file. To complete the monochrome pointillism homepage:

1. Download or obtain a high-contrast, public-domain portrait image
2. Save it as: assets/michelangelo.jpg
3. Delete this .placeholder file

The portrait should be:
- High contrast (good for pointillism conversion)
- Square or landscape orientation preferred
- Public domain or properly licensed
- Good resolution (at least 1000px on the longest side)

Example sources:
- Wikimedia Commons public domain portraits
- Project Gutenberg illustrations
- Your own photography (if you have permission)

Once you have the actual image file, the homepage will automatically use it for the pointillism rendering.
