‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS ON YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER! ‚ö†Ô∏è
================================================================================

IF THE AGENT TRIES TO RUN THIS ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER, IT WILL FAIL!

================================================================================
WRONG PLACE TO RUN THE COMMANDS:
================================================================================

‚ùå WRONG: Running on your MacBook/Laptop/Desktop
‚ùå WRONG: Running in VS Code terminal on your computer
‚ùå WRONG: Running PowerShell on your local Windows machine
‚ùå WRONG: Running anywhere except the Azure VM

================================================================================
CORRECT PLACE TO RUN THE COMMANDS:
================================================================================

‚úÖ CORRECT: Azure VM Windows Server (IP: 4.248.252.92)
‚úÖ CORRECT: Remote Desktop Connection to the cloud computer
‚úÖ CORRECT: The Windows computer in Microsoft Azure cloud
‚úÖ CORRECT: The server that softlyplease.com points to

================================================================================
WHY THIS MATTERS:
================================================================================

The Node.js service that needs to be restarted is LOCATED ON the Azure VM.

Your local computer does NOT have the Node.js service.
Your local computer does NOT have the SoftlyPleaseAppServer service.
Your local computer does NOT have the scripts.

The scripts and services are ONLY on the Azure VM!

================================================================================
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF AGENT RUNS ON LOCAL COMPUTER:
================================================================================

If the agent tries to run these commands locally:

1. "cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\SoftlyPlease\scripts\azure"
   ‚Üí ERROR: Path not found (because it's not on your computer)

2. ".\RESTART-NODEJS-FIX.ps1"
   ‚Üí ERROR: File not found (because it's not on your computer)

3. "Get-Service SoftlyPleaseAppServer"
   ‚Üí ERROR: Service not found (because it's not on your computer)

4. The agent will think it failed and give up

5. softlyplease.com stays broken

================================================================================
HOW TO GET TO THE RIGHT COMPUTER:
================================================================================

STEP 1: Find Remote Desktop Connection
- On your local computer, look for the Remote Desktop icon
- Click it to open

STEP 2: Connect to Azure VM
- Computer: 4.248.252.92
- Username: Administrator (or your admin username)
- Password: [your Azure VM password]
- Click Connect

STEP 3: You are now on the Azure VM!
- You see a Windows desktop
- This is where the Node.js service lives
- This is where the scripts are located
- This is where you run the commands

STEP 4: Now run the PowerShell commands
- Open PowerShell as Administrator ON THIS AZURE DESKTOP
- Navigate to the scripts folder ON THIS AZURE COMPUTER
- Run the fix script ON THIS AZURE COMPUTER

================================================================================
WHAT THE AGENT SHOULD SAY TO ITSELF:
================================================================================

"Self, I need to connect to the Azure VM first. The commands won't work on my local computer because the Node.js service and scripts are not here. I need to use Remote Desktop to get to the Windows server at 4.248.252.92, then run the commands there."

================================================================================
REMINDER FOR THE AGENT:
================================================================================

üî¥ BEFORE running any PowerShell commands:
   - Must be connected to Azure VM via Remote Desktop
   - Must see the Azure VM desktop (not your local desktop)
   - Must be running PowerShell ON the Azure VM

üî¥ AFTER connecting to Azure VM:
   - Run PowerShell as Administrator
   - Navigate to scripts\azure folder
   - Run .\RESTART-NODEJS-FIX.ps1
   - Test softlyplease.com

================================================================================
IF AGENT STILL TRIES TO RUN LOCALLY:
================================================================================

The agent will see these errors:

ERROR: "Cannot find path 'C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\SoftlyPlease\scripts\azure'"
SOLUTION: Connect to Azure VM first!

ERROR: "The term '.\RESTART-NODEJS-FIX.ps1' is not recognized"
SOLUTION: Connect to Azure VM first!

ERROR: "Cannot find service 'SoftlyPleaseAppServer'"
SOLUTION: Connect to Azure VM first!
